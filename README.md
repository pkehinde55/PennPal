A Java chat server application that can handle multiple "Users" and Multiple group chats

Directions to run
1. Before launching the client, fire up your server by running the file ServerMain.java in Eclipse. You should see a small window pop up which indicates the server is running.

2. Now, launch an instance of the client, either by double-clicking on the JAR file, or selecting Open With... JAR launcher (or some equivalent program). If you are unable to run the client, try opening the directory containing the client JAR in a terminal, and executing the command java -jar hw07-client.jar. You will need to repeat this process to test your server with multiple instances of the client application.

3. Once the client is running, you will be prompted to enter the IP address of the server. Since you are running the server on your own computer, the address you should enter is localhost. Note that the client will not display all of the channels on the serverâ€”to populate the list on the left-hand side, you will either have to create or join a channel.
